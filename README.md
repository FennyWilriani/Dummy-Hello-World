# Markdown starter worksheet
the main goal of markdown is to be easily written and easily read. It is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Coined by  John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, markdown in 2004 as a markup language seems appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
